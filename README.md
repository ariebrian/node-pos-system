# node-pos-system
Used NodeJS v14.17.1
Used Express.js framework for the REST API
Used PostgreSQL to store data
Used Sequelize as the ORM
Used JWT for the authentication

models, migration and seeders can be found in the folder ./migrations and ./seeders
config database can be found in ./config/config.json

models to connect controller and database can be found in the ./app/models
( I am sorry for the double model because this is the first time i use node.js so it was a little hard for the migration and seeding process so i had to do this)

I also attached the postman collection and backup file of the database.

Thanks for the test, it was a big learning opportunity for me especially because i never use node before this
Thanks for your time, hope to hear from you anytime soon.
